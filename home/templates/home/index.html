            <h1>Activities</h1>
            <p>Washington is a wonderful place to visit with children -- there are numerous, fun Smithsonian museums on the National Mall covering natural history, American history, air &amp; space, and much more. You can visit the historic landmarks of the Washington Monument, Lincoln and Jefferson memorials, the Capitol, and see the White House. Try the paddle boats on the Tidal Basin, surrounded by cherry blossoms; the National Zoo; and the kid-oriented Spy Museum. We'd love for families to make it a family holiday and we'd be delighted to arrange childcare and activities for children on the day of the wedding. Please let us know and we can send more information.</p>
            <p>Weather in Washington in April can be beautiful but is a bit unpredictable, with high temperatures ranging from 55 degrees F to 85 degrees F, normally around 60F. Rain is always a possibility too. We recommend you check before you come, and just be prepared for anything</p>
            <p>If you're looking for some light entertainment between now and the wedding, some of you have already found the video below to check on our progress with dancing lessons ("Lucy and Braden dancing"). Watch at least through 1 minute to get the full effect.</p>
